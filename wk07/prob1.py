* selling n houses along a street.

* we already workout the amount we get from selling each house.
- the element in the houses list is the profit we get from each house

* We can't sell houses right next to each other.

* We have to select a subset of houses such that we make the most amount of money.

starting with the i-th house what are my actions?

1. Sell to this house: Get profit for this house, but then you cannot sell to adjacent houses.
    - profit from houses[0 .. i-2] + sale of houses[i]

2. Skip this house: Get no profit from this house, but you keep your options open for adjacent houses.
    - skip house i and take max profit from houses [0 .. i - 1]
    - profit from houses[0 .. i-1]

Base cases:
- What's the maximum profit for just house 0?
    - profit = house[0]
    
- What's the maximum profit when considering only houses 0 and 1?
    - profit = max(house[0], house[1])

Optimal substructure:
    memo[0] = houses[0]
    memo[1] = max(houses[0], houses[1])
    memo[i] = max(houses[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1]) for i >= 2
    
Overlapping sub problems:
    - Initially we have the base cases memo[0] and memo[1]
    - For i >= 2, we use those previous base cases in our optimal substructure
        - memo[i] = max(houses[i] + memo[i - 2], memo[i - 1])
    - These solved problems overlap, hence we can solve the full problem using
        our optimal substructure.
