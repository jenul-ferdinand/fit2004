## Overview
This repository contains my complete work for FIT2004.
- Random problem solutions (`problems/`)
- Past exam papers & their solutions for some (`exams/`)
- Implementations of standard algorithms (graph, sorting, searching).
- Data-structure implementations in `data_structures/`.
- Dynamic programming in `dp/`.
- Weekly problem sets and solutions in `wk01/` ... `wk12/`.

## Repository Structure
┌── .exams/ # Past exam papers + solutions <br/>
├── algorithms_graph/ # Graph algorithms (Ford–Fulkerson, Dijkstra, DFS, BFS, etc.) <br/>
├── algorithms_searching/ # Searching algorithms (binary search, and more) <br/>
├── algorithms_sorting/ # Sorting algorithms (merge, quick, insertion, etc.) <br/>
├── data_structures/ # BST, AVL, 2-3 Tree, Trie, RBT, etc. <br/>
├── dp/ # Dynamic programming problems (knapsack, coins, fib, …) <br/>
├── problems/ # Random problem solutions <br/>
├── wk01/ … wk12/ # Weekly tutorial problem sets & solutions <br/>
├── README.md # ← You are here <br/>
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies <br/>
└── .gitignore

## Running Examples
Each folder contains a `__main__` section.

You can just run the file e.g.
```sh
python algorithms_sorting/insertion_sort.py
```

## Past Exams
Browse `exams/` for PDFs of past papers and their solutions.
