# FIT2004 : Algorithms and Data Structures
## Overview
This repository contains my complete work for FIT2004.
- Random problem solutions (`problems/`)
- Past exam papers & their solutions (`exams/`, `exams_more/`)
- Implementations of standard algorithms (graph, sorting, searching).
- Data-structure implementations in `data_structures/`.
- Dynamic programming in `dp/`.
- Weekly problem sets and solutions in `wk01/` ... `wk12/`.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Examples
Each folder contains a `__main__` section.

You can just run the file e.g.
```sh
python algorithms_sorting/insertion_sort.py
```

## Past Exams
Browse `exams/` and `exams_more/` for PDFs of past papers and their solutions.
