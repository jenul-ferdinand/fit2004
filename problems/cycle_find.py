? Name: Detect Cycle in Undirected Graph

? Description:
Given an undirected graph with n vertices 0 to n-1 and a list of edges.

Determine whether the garph contains any cycle. 

A cycle in an undirected graph is a path that starts and ends at the same 
vertex, with at least one edge, and with no edge repeated.

- Track the "parent" of each DFS step to avoid falsely treating the immediate 
back-edge as a cycle.

? Input:
- n: An integer, the number of vertices.
- edges: A list of m tuples (u,v).

? Output: 
- Return True if there is at least one cycle in the graph, False otherwise.
