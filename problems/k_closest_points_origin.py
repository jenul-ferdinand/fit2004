K Closest Points to Origin

? Description
Given a list of points in the 2D plane (x, y).

Return the k points closet to the the origin (0, 0).

Distance is measured by Euclidean distance. 

You must implement an expected O(n) time algorithm using QuickSelect to
partition the points by their squared distance to the origin.
