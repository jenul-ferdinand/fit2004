Race Category Assignment

A race organiser wants to assign runners into three categories based on their
finish times (in seconds). Specifically:
    - The slowest 10% of runners are labeled "Novice".
    - The fastest 10% of runners are labeled "Elite".
    - The remaining 80% are labeled "Intermediate".
    
There are N runners and each finish time is a float. You may assume all finish
times are distinct. Design an O(N) expected-time algorithm using QuickSelect
to compute the cut-off times and partition the list into the three categories.

Approach:
- Calculate the order statistics for top 10 and bottom 10 percent
- Use quick select to find the thresholds for top 10 and bottom 10 percent
- Single pass over the times to append to either the novices, intermediates, or
    elites lists.
- Output the three lists in a tuple.
