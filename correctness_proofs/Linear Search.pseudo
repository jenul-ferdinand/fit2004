LI: if target in A[1..i-1], then the index holds A[i] that is equal to target,
or null if there is no match.

On initialisation before i=1, the prefix A[1..0] is empty, there is no match
for target, so index = null holds.

On iteration i=k, assume that if target in A[1..k-1], then the index holds A[k]
that is equal to target, or null if there is no match.

- If A[k] == target then we update index = k.
- If A[k] != target then we continue to the next iteration

At the end of the iteration, the invariant holds before the next iteration.

On termination, we know that i=n+1 the invariant ensures that if target appears
anywhere in A[1..n], index is its last occurrence; otherwise index = null. 
Retuning index is therefore correct.
