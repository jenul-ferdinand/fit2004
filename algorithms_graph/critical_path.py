    Calculates the length of the longest path (critical path) in a DAG
    starting from a given node using recursion with memoisation.
    
    Args:
        edges: A list of edges, where each edge is (weight, u, v).
                Nodes u and v are assumed to be 0-indexed.
                
        start_node: The node from which to start finding the longest path.
        
    Returns:
        The length of the longest path starting from start_node.
        Returns 0 if the start_node has no outgoing paths or doesn't exist.
        Raises ValueError if the graph contains cycles (not checked here, 
        assumes DAG)
